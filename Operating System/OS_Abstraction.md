+ What is an operating system? 

	― Memory management 
	― I/O management
	― CPU scheduling
	― Communication?


+ CPU management
	CPU scheduling with conflicting goals: 
	― Response time – interactivity
	― Throughput – CPU and I/O
	― Fairness and avoiding starvation
	― Simplicity of scheduler ― Limiting overhead


+ CPU abstractions
	The thread – a virtual CPU
	Represents registers
	Has independent stack
	― but in (potentially shared) address space
